In this experiment, your memory for lists of words will be tested. 

Each list will contain {avg_words_per_list} words, these will be show one at time
for a few seconds.

	page2 = ''' 
Your memory will be tested either by a *recognition memory* test or
by a *recall* test.

In a recognition memory test, you will be presented with words, shown one at a
time, and you will indicate whether each word was in the list of words you saw.

In the recall memory test, you will be given a set of boxes where you will
type in all the words that you can remember from the word list.
